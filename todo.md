Currently working on TruthOrDare. will optimize, make it look nice, etc.
Will then begin work on 21 questions (these seem like the two most low hanging fruit)

Taimur:
Up to u.

Functionality:
_ Add ToD prompts.
_ Decide what will be the subscription feature of our app. More prompts for ToD, access to exclusive game modes?
Build the other games.

Presentation:
_ Nice home screen.
_ Make a uniform color code across components as defined within the AppStyles.js file, and go into certain files
and implement this standard. \* Make Truth or Dare presentable.
