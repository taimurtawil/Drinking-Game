finished ToD and Never have I ever. still have to make it look nice but it works.
Think it might be worth it to have one customizable component for selecting game modes - call it ModeSelector.js. You can pass a prop into this component for whichever game you'll be selecting the mode for (prop "game"), and given this it will return acomponent with various options and routes. but one file for a centralized format and modularity sounds better than the current implementation.

Ex. ModeSelector({game: "Truth or Dare"}) should return the same screen that the truth or dare mode selector currently returns. There can be another file with the necessary data of what should be returned.

Taimur:
Up to u.

Functionality:
_ Add ToD prompts.
_ Decide what will be the subscription feature of our app. More prompts for ToD, access to exclusive game modes?
Build the other games.

Presentation:
_ Nice home screen.
_ Make a uniform color code across components as defined within the AppStyles.js file, and go into certain files
and implement this standard. \* Make Truth or Dare presentable.
